# chopper_demo

Application showcasing illustration for core concepts such as Chopper, bloc, flavor, mock
environment, dependency injection, pagination etc.

## Getting Started

### Chopper demo

<ins>commands</ins>
- for creating auto generated files => **flutter packages pub run build_runner watch**
note if while generating we get any issue we can try **Invalidate cache** and then run following
 commands.</br>
 **flutter clean**
 **flutter pub get**
 **flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs**
 then run that  **flutter packages pub run build_runner watch**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Flavor build generation commands**
- for creating flavor builds => **flutter build apk --flavor prod**
- for creating flavor builds with entry point configuration => **flutter build apk --flavor prod -t
 lib/main_prod.dart**
 note:
  1.  just keep string translatable false for production or lint disabling for translatable
  from gradle.
  2. todo : IOS flavor is remaining, as XCode is required for that.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps for creating built auto generated file: 
1. create [built_Model] file create BuiltModel class. (note: you can use blts custom made snippet)
2. add builtclass name under const parameter in serializer class and see if autogenerated
 serializer class have its setter implementation (eg: @SerializersFor(const [BuiltPost,BuiltJob]))
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 ### FlutterBloc Demo
 
 - Note if you don't want to rebuild widget on state change , its okay we don't have to make a
  state or event for it we can handle simply on the particular action. But there might be something
  which can prevent re-building the widget look for it in the documentation or somewhere.
   
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ### Dependency injection
  
  - Used get_it library for this. 
  - look for injection container.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Todo:
1. flavour implementation is not complete as I am unable to get flavor in code. (I guess as I
 have not implemented for IOS, it so) so implement it afterwards.
2. mock failure response is remaining to parse.
